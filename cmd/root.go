Nog is an interface between local code and a containerised quarkus
development environment. Nog mounts local maven repos, source code etc
into the container running quarkus and allows you to develop in your
IDE and have Quarkus (in a container ) build and run it.

As an added bonus Nog also includes a browser based IDE to allow
for the full quarkus experience without having to install anything.

Well except for Nog - and you've already done that.
